Now that you know how to use both cherry-pick and the interactive rebase, this practice level is designed to put to use your previously learned skills.
>>>
Let's say you were working on a bug fix and you added a few debugging commands and print statements in their own commits.
Once you've fixed the bug, you don't want to commit the debugging and print statements with your bug fix.
>>>
To visualize this lets say that there are 4 commits, commit 1 "master" , commit 2 "debug", commit 3 "printf", and commit 4 "bugFix".
>>>
To complete this level, copy only the bugFix into the master branch using "rebase -i" or "cherry-pick".
hint: Since you've just committed the bug fix, remember that your HEAD is at bugFix and not master.
