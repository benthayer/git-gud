This level is designed to help you learn how to merge.
It will show the steps one at a time, and after the explanation, you can go and try it for yourself.
>>>
Make a new branch called bugFix by typing the command "git branch bugFix"
>>>
Checkout the bugFix branch with "git checkout bugFix"
>>>
Commit once ("git gud commit")
>>>
Go back to master with "git checkout master"
>>>
Commit another time, this time on the master branch.
 Use the command "git gud show tree" to see the commit tree. This command simulates "git log --graph --oneline --all".
 Take a note of what it looks like now so you can compare it to what the commit tree looks like after the merge.
>>>
Finally, merge the branch bugFix into master with "git merge bugFix".
 Look at the tree again to see the changes made by the merge.
 The merge has the "head" commits of both master and bugFix as it's "parent commits". Normal commits only have one
 parent, but merges can have two parents.

 Note: The initial commit is another kind of special commit. It doesn't have any parents!
 Try it out now!
