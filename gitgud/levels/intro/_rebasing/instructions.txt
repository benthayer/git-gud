This level will familiarize you with the concept of git rebasing!
>>>
Rebasing in git is an alternative way of combining two different branches (recall the last method: merging).
>>>
Start by creating a branched commit tree:
(Remember: use "git branch <branch_name>" and "git checkout <branch_name>" to create a new branch).
>>>
Great! Now let's try merging these branches. Use "git rebase master" to rebase your new branch with master. This will copy the rebased branch below master, using master as it's parent node.
>>>
Now that we know how to rebase, try merging a git branch with the rebase command yourself!
