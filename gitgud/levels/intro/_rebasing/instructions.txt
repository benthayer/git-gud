This level will familiarize you with the concept of git rebasing!
>>>
Rebasing in git is an alternative way of combining two different branches (recall the last method: merging).
>>>
In the current tree, you can see that our commit tree has two different branches, "master" and "bugFix", both diverging from node 1.
>>>
In order to merge bugFix into master, we checkout the bugFix branch, and run "git rebase master". This will copy the bugFix branch below master, using master as it's parent node. The command "git log --graph --oneline" is a useful tool to observe the new "flattened" commit tree.
>>>
Also: observe what happens if we now checkout master, and execute "git rebase bugFix". Since master is already the ancestor of bugFix, the branch reference simply moves up to the position of bugFix.
>>>
Phew, that was a lot! Now that we know the basics, try rebasing a branch by yourself!
