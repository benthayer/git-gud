In this level, we're going to go over a feature only a few people know about and even fewer know how to use properly: the octopus merge!
>>>
Performing an octopus merge is very similar to creating a normal merge,
 the only difference is the number of commits specified.
An octopus merge can be a merge between 8 branches, but despite its' name,
 it can also be less than that... or more! The only requirement is that there be more than two commits.
>>>
Remember: the branch that is currently checked out is always included in the merge!
Checkout master and run `git merge feature feature2` to create an octopus merge and complete the level!
